# Using Front-End Frameworks in Your portlets [](id=using-front-end-frameworks-in-your-portlets)

You can use the most popular Front-End frameworks in your portlets with just a 
few minor updates to the standard portlet configuration. To help kick-start your 
portlet project, you can choose from several 
[Blade portlet project templates](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/project-templates). 
The following templates are covered in this section:

- Angular
- React
- Vue

Alternatively, you can 
[use @product@'s front-end toolset](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/creating-and-bundling-javascript-portlets-with-javascript-tooling) 
to build JavaScript-based portlets. The tutorials in this section show how to 
use front-end frameworks in your portlets.

**Note:** JavaScript Server-Side-Rendering is not supported out-of-the-box. To 
use JS frameworks for site rendering, you **must** set up your server-side 
(or search-crawler) rendering generation to support them.
