# Customizing the Product Menu [](id=customizing-the-product-menu)

By default, Liferay's Product Menu consists of three main sections: Control
Panel, User Menu, and Site Administration. These sections are called panel
categories. For instance, the Control Panel is a single panel category, and when
clicking on it, you see four child panel categories: *Users*, *Sites*, *Apps*,
and *Configuration*. Clicking a child panel category shows panel apps.

**Note:** The Product Menu cannot be changed by applying a new theme. To change
the layout/style of the Product Menu, you must create and deploy a theme
contributor. See the
[Theme Contributors](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/packaging-independent-ui-resources-for-your-site)
tutorial for more details.

The Product Menu is intuitive and easy to use---but you can still change it any
way you want. You can reorganize the panel categories and apps, or add
completely new categories and populate them with custom panel apps. Here you'll
learn how to provide new or modified panel categories and panel apps for the
Product Menu.
