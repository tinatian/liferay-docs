# Product Navigation [](id=product-navigation)

Liferay's product navigation consists of the main menus you use to customize,
configure, and navigate the system. When you edit a page, switch to a different
Site scope, access a User's credentials, etc., you're using the default
navigation menus. Providing a customization to a default menu can help give your
Liferay instance a unique touch. You can extend and customize the default
product navigation to fit your need.

There are four product navigation sections that you can extend: Product Menu,
Control Menu, Simulation Menu, and User Personal Menu.

The Product Menu is on the left, and displays the Control Panel, User account
settings, and Site Administration functionality. The Control Menu is on top,
offering navigation to the Product Menu, Simulation Menu (the right menu),
and the *Add* button. When certain settings are enabled (e.g., Staging, Page
Customization, etc.), more tools are offered. The Simulation Menu offers options
to simulate your Site's look for different scenarios (devices, user segments,
etc.). Finally, the User Personal Menu holds selectable items containing a
user's own account settings.

In this section of tutorials, you'll learn about the various ways you can extend
and customize Liferay's product navigation to fit your needs.
