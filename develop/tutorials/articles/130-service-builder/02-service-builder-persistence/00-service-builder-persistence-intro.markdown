# Service Builder Persistence [](id=service-builder-persistence)

Liferay's Service Builder can generate your project's persistence layer by
automating the creation of interfaces and classes. Your application's
persistence layer persists data represented by your configured entities to a
database. In fact, your local service implementation classes are responsible for
calling the persistence layer to retrieve and store your application's data. So
instead of taking the time-consuming route of writing your own persistence
layer, you can use Service Builder to quickly define your entities and
generate the layer instantaneously.
