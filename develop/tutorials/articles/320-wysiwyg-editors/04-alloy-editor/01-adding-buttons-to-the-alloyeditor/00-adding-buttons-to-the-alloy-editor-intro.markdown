# Adding Buttons to AlloyEditor's Toolbars [](id=adding-buttons-to-alloyeditor-toolbars)

AlloyEditor's toolbars contain several useful functions out-of-the-box. You 
may, however, want to customize the default configuration to include a button
you've created, to add an existing button to a toolbar, or to add an 
[existing CKEditor button that's bundled with @product@'s AlloyEditor](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/ckeditor-plugin-reference-guide).
The 
[`EditorConfigContributor` interface](https://docs.liferay.com/ce/portal/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-kernel/com/liferay/portal/kernel/editor/configuration/EditorConfigContributor.html), 
provides everything you need to modify an editor's configuration, including 
adding buttons to AlloyEditor's toolbars. 
[CKEditor Configuration settings](https://docs.ckeditor.com/ckeditor4/latest/api/CKEDITOR_config.html) 
that modify the editor's behavior (excluding UI modifications) can also be 
passed down through this configuration object. 

The `com.liferay.docs.my.button` module is the example throughout these 
tutorials. If you want to use it as a starting point for your own configuration
or follow along with the tutorials, you can download the module's zip file from
the
[Github repo](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-docs/tree/master/develop/tutorials/code/osgi/modules/com.liferay.docs.my.button).
