# JSP Overrides Using Custom JSP Bag [](id=jsp-overrides-using-custom-jsp-bag)

Liferay's API based approaches to overriding JSPs (i.e.,
[Dynamic Includes](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-jsps-with-dynamic-includes)
and
[Portlet Filters](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/jsp-overrides-using-portlet-filters))
are the best way to override JSPs in apps and in the core. You can also use
Custom JSP Bags to override core JSPs. But the approach is not as stable as the
API based approaches. If your Custom JSP Bag's JSP is buggy (because of your
code or because of a change in Liferay), you are most likely to find out at
runtime, where functionality breaks and nasty log errors greet you. Using
Custom JSP Bags to override JSPs is a bad practice, equivalent to using Ext
plugins to customize @product@. If you're maintaining existing Custom JSP Bags,
however, this tutorial explains how they work.

**Important:** Liferay cannot guarantee that JSPs overridden using Custom JSP
Bag can be upgraded.

A Custom JSP Bag module must satisfy these criteria: 

-   Includes a class that implements the
    [`CustomJspBag` interface](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-impl/com/liferay/portal/deploy/hot/CustomJspBag.html).

-   Registers the service in the OSGi runtime.

-   Provides the JSP you're extending.

The module provides transportation for this code into Liferay's OSGi runtime.
When configuring it to build a proper JAR, map the path of the JSPs in the JAR
to their path in your module. In a `bnd.bnd` file you could specify 

    -includeresource: META-INF/jsps=src/META-INF/custom_jsps

If you're using the Maven [Standard Directory Layout](https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-standard-directory-layout.html)
and placing your JSPs under `src/main/resources`, you can ignore the
`-includeresource` directive.

Any core JSPs you're customizing should be put into this folder, and the rest of
the path and name must match exactly the path and name of the JSP that's nested
underneath `portal-web/docroot/html`. For example, if you're overriding

    portal-web/docroot/html/common/themes/bottom-ext.jsp 

and you used the `includeresource` directive above, put the overridden JSP in
this folder of your module:

    my-module/src/META-INF/custom_jsps/html/common/themes/bottom-ext.jsp

## Implement a Custom JSP Bag [](id=implement-a-custom-jsp-bag)

Create a class that implements `CustomJspBag`. The goal is to make sure that
Liferay (specifically the
[`CustomJspBagRegistryUtil` class](@platform-ref@/7.1-latest/javadocs/portal-impl/com/liferay/portal/deploy/hot/CustomJspBagRegistryUtil.html))
loads the JSPs from your module upon activation.

    public class MyCustomJspBag implements CustomJspBag {

When the Component is activated, you must add the URL path for all your custom
core JSPs (by directory path) to a `List`.

        @Activate
        protected void activate(BundleContext bundleContext) {
            bundle = bundleContext.getBundle();

            _customJsps = new ArrayList<>();

            Enumeration<URL> entries = bundle.findEntries(
                getCustomJspDir(), "*.jsp", true);

            while (entries.hasMoreElements()) {
                URL url = entries.nextElement();

                _customJsps.add(url.getPath());
            }
        }

        ...

        private List<String> _customJsps;

        private Bundle bundle;

In the custom JSP bag you must override the following methods:

-  **`getCustomJspDir`:** Return the directory path in your
module's JAR where the JSPs are placed (for example, `META-INF/jsps`).

-  **`getCustomJsps`:** Return a List of the custom JSP URL paths.

-  **`getURLContainer`:** Return a new
   `com.liferay.portal.kernel.url.URLContainer`. Instantiate the URL container
   and override its `getResources` and `getResource` methods. The `getResources`
   method looks up all the paths to resources in the container by a given path.
   It returns a `HashSet` of `Strings` for the matching custom JSP paths. The
   `getResource` method returns one specific resource by its name (the path
   included).

-  **`isCustomJspGlobal`:** Return `true`.

For an example of a full class that provides a working implementation of a
custom JSP bag, refer to the
[Core Override JSP sample project](/develop/reference/-/knowledge_base/7-1/core-jsp-hook).

## Register the Custom JSP Bag [](id=register-the-custom-jsp-bag)

Register the custom JSP bag implementation from your module in the OSGi runtime
with three properties:

-  **`context.id`:** Specify your custom JSP bag class name. For example,
   `MyCustomJspBag`.

-  **`contex.name`:** This should be a more human readable name, like `My Custom
   JSP Bag`.

-  **`service.ranking:Integer`:** This determines the priority of your
   implementation. If you specify `100` here, and one of your coworkers develops
   a separate custom JSP bag implementation and gives theirs a ranking of `101`,
   you're out of luck. Theirs will take precedence. Logically then, you should
   use `102`.

## Extend a JSP [](id=extend-a-jsp)

If you want to add something to a core JSP, see if it has an empty `-ext.jsp`
and override that instead of the whole JSP. It keeps things simpler and more
stable, since the full JSP might change significantly, breaking your
customization in the process. By overriding the `-ext.jsp`, you're only relying
on the original JSP including the `-ext.jsp`. For an example, open
`portal-web/docroot/html/common/themes/bottom.jsp`, and scroll to the end.
You'll see this:

    <liferay-util:include page="/html/common/themes/bottom-ext.jsp" />

If you must add something to `bottom.jsp`, override `bottom-ext.jsp`. 

Since @product@ 7.0, the content from the following JSP files formerly in
`html/common/themes` are inlined to improve performance.
 
- `body_bottom-ext.jsp`
- `body_top-ext.jsp`
- `bottom-ext.jsp`
- `bottom-test.jsp`

They're no longer explicit files in the code base. But you can still create them
in your module to add functionality and content. 

Remember, this type of customization is a last resort. Your override may break
due to the nature of this implementation, and core functionality in Liferay can
go down with it. If the JSP you want to override is in another module, refer to
the section on 
[API based approaches to overriding JSPs](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/jsp-overrides-using-custom-jsp-bag#using-portals-api-to-override-a-jsp).

## Site Scoped JSP Customization [](id=site-scoped-jsp-customization)

In Liferay Portal 6.2, you could use
[Application Adapters](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/customizing-sites-and-site-templates-with-application-adapters)
to scope your core JSP customizations to a specific Site. Since the majority of
JSPs were moved into modules for @product@ 7.0, the use case for this has shrunk
considerably. If you must scope a core JSP customization to a Site, prepare an
application adapter 
[as you would have for Liferay Portal 6.2](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/6-2/customizing-sites-and-site-templates-with-application-adapters),
and deploy it to @product-ver@. It will still work. However, note that this
approach is deprecated in @product-ver@ and won't be supported at all in Liferay
8.0.

<!-- Uncomment once we cover scoping to a site
If you're interested in scoping a module's JSP customization to a site, that's
another story. See the documentation on [using Dynamic Include](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-jsps-with-dynamic-includes).
