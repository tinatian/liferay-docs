# Providing Entity-Specific Local Services for Staging [](id=providing-entity-specific-local-services-for-staging)

When creating your data handlers, you must leverage your app's local services to
perform Staging-related tasks for its entities. When the Staging framework
operates on entities (i.e., staged models), it often cannot manage important
information from the entity's local services alone; instead, you're forced to
reinvent basic functionality so the Staging framework can access it. This is
caused by services not sharing a common ancestor (i.e., interface or base
class).

The *Staged Model Repository* framework removes this barrier by linking an app's
staged model to a local service. This lets the Staging framework call a
staged model repository independently based on the entity being processed. This
gives you access to entity-specific methods tailored specifically for the
staged model data you're handling.

What kind of *entity-specific* methods are we talking about here? Your data
handlers only expose a specific set of actions, like export and import methods.
The Staged Model Repository framework provides CRUD operations for a specific
staged model that are not exposed using local services.

The staged model repository does not avoid using your app's local services. It
only provides an additional layer that provides Staging-specific functionality.
So how does this work? A brief Staging process is outlined below:

- `*StagedModelDataHandler` de-serializes the provided
  [LAR file's](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/understanding-data-handlers#liferay-archive-lar-file)
  XML into a model.
- `*StagedModelRepository` updates the model based on the environment and
  business logic, providing entity-specific CRUD operations for Staging purposes
  (e.g., UUID manipulation).
- Local services are called from the `*StagedModelRepository` and handles the
  remainder of the process.

Pretty cool, right? Read on to learn how to implement and use the Staged Model
Repository framework in your app.
