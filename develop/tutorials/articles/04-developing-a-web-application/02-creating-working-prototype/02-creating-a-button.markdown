# Creating an Add Entry Button [](id=creating-an-add-guestbook-button)

    <p>Developing Your First Portlet<br>Step 2 of 8</p>
</div>

A guestbook application is pretty simple, right? People come to your site and 
post their names and brief messages. Other users can read these entries and post 
their own. 

When you created your project, it generated a file named `view.jsp` in your
project's `src/main/resources/META-INF/resources` folder. This file contains the
default view for users when the portlet is added to the page. Right now it 
contains sample content: 

    <%@ include file="/init.jsp" %>

    <p>
        <b><liferay-ui:message key="guestbook-web.caption"/></b>
    </p>

First, `view.jsp` imports `init.jsp`. By convention, imports and tag library
declarations are in an `init.jsp` file. The other JSP files in the application
import `init.jsp`. This lets you handle JSP dependency management in a single
file. 

Besides importing `init.jsp`, `view.jsp` displays a message defined by a
language key. This key and its value are declared in your project's
`src/main/resources/content/Language.properties` file. 

It's time to start developing the Guestbook application. First, users need a way 
to add a guestbook entry. In `view.jsp`, follow these steps to add this button: 

1.  Remove everything under the include for `init.jsp`. 

2.  Below the include, add the following 
    [AlloyUI](http://alloyui.com/) tags to display an Add Entry button inside of 
    a button row: 

        <aui:button-row>
            <aui:button value="Add Entry"></aui:button>
        </aui:button-row>

You can use `aui` tags in `view.jsp` since `init.jsp` declares the AlloyUI tag 
library by default (as well as other important imports and tags): 

        <%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core" prefix="c" %>
        <%@ taglib uri="http://java.sun.com/portlet_2_0" prefix="portlet" %>

        <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/aui" prefix="aui" %>
        <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/portlet" prefix="liferay-portlet" %>
        <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/theme" prefix="liferay-theme" %>
        <%@ taglib uri="http://liferay.com/tld/ui" prefix="liferay-ui" %>

        <portlet:defineObjects />

        <liferay-theme:defineObjects />

Your application now displays a button instead of a message, but the button 
doesn't do anything. Next, you'll create a URL for your button.
