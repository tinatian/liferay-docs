# Creating a Working Prototype [](id=creating-a-working-prototype)

So far, you've installed Liferay @ide@ and created a Liferay Workspace. Next,
you'll create your application and start adding features to it. Here's what
you'll do: 

-   Create your application and deploy it to your @product@ instance. 
-   Create a functional button for adding and removing guestbook entries. 
-   Create a form for users to create and edit guestbook entries. 
-   Create a UI for displaying guestbook entries. 
-   Implement a prototype storage system (to be replaced later) for storing 
    guestbook entries. 

At the end, you'll have a fully functional prototype application ready to be
enhanced later! There's no time like now to get started.
