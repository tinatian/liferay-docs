# Developing a Web Application [](id=developing-a-web-application)

In this Learning Path, you'll create the Liferay Guestbook Web Application from 
scratch using tools like Liferay @ide@ and Blade tools. As you create this 
application, you'll learn how to create a back-end database, web services, a 
security model, UI, and more using all the best practices and standards.
Completing this Learning Path prepares you to write your own application
and further explore Liferay's APIs. 

To develop a web application with Liferay, start at the beginning: setting up a 
Liferay development environment. Though you can use anything from a text editor 
and the command line to your Java IDE of choice, Liferay @ide@ optimizes
development on Liferay's platform. It integrates Liferay's Blade tools for
modular development. 

Once you set up your development environment, you can create the application.
From modeling data to Service Builder, you'll learn everything you need to know
to create and run your application. 

From there you'll see everything from UI standards to providing remote 
services. Once everything is completed and wrapped up with a bow, you can 
distribute the application on Marketplace.
