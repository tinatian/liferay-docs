# What is Service Builder? [](id=what-is-service-builder-0)

    <p>Generating the Back-end<br>Step 1 of 3</p>
</div>

Now you'll use Service Builder to generate create, read, update, delete, and
find operations for your application. You'll also use Service Builder to 
generate the necessary model, persistence, and service layers for your 
application. Then you can add your application's necessary business logic. 

## Guestbook Application Design [](id=guestbook-application-design)

In the prototype application, you defined a single guestbook's entries and 
displayed them in a list. The full application will handle multiple Guestbooks 
and their entries. To make this work, you'll create two tables in the database: 
one for guestbooks and one for guestbook entries.

## Service Layer [](id=service-layer)

This application is data-driven. It uses services for storing and retrieving 
data. The application asks for data, and the service fetches it from the
persistence layer. The application can then display this data to the user, who
reads or modifies it. If the data is modified, the application passes it back
to the service, and which calls the persistence layer to store it. The
application doesn't need to know anything about how the service does what it
does. 

To get started, you'll create a Service Builder project and populate its 
`service.xml` file with all the necessary entities to generate this code: 

1.  In Liferay @ide@, click *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay Module Project*.

2.  Name the project `guestbook`.

3.  Select `service-builder` for the Project Template Name.
 
4.  Click *Next*.

5.  Enter `com.liferay.docs.guestbook` for the *Package Name*.

6.  Click *Finish*.

This creates two modules: an API module (`guestbook-api`) and a service module 
(`guestbook-service`). Next, you'll learn how to use them.
