    <p>Writing the Guestbook Admin App<br>Step 1 of 5</p>
</div>

Because the Guestbook and Guestbook Admin applications should be bundled
together, you'll create the new application manually inside the `guestbook-web`
project, rather than by using a wizard. If you disagree with this design
decision, you can create a separate project for Guestbook Admin; the project 
template you'd use is *panel-app*. For now, however, it's better to go through 
the process manually to learn how it all works: 

1.  Right-click the `com.liferay.docs.guestbook.portlet` package in the
    `guestbook-web` project and select *New* &rarr; *Class*. 

2.  Name the class `GuestbookAdminPortlet`. 

3.  Click *Browse* next to the Superclass and search for `MVCPortlet`. Click it
    and select *OK*. 

4.  Click *Finish*. 

You now have your Guestbook Admin application's portlet class. For an 
administrative application, however, you need at least one more component. 

## Panels and Categories [](id=panels-and-categories)

As described in the 
[product menu tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-the-product-menu), 
there are three sections of the product menu as illustrated below. 

![Figure 1: The product menu is split into three sections: the Control Panel, the User menu, and the Sites menu.](../../../images/product-menu-parts.png)

Each section is called a *panel category*. A panel category can hold various 
menu items called *panel apps*. In the illustration above, the Sites menu is 
open to reveal its panel apps and categories (yes, you can nest them). 

The most natural place for the Guestbook Admin portlet is in the *Content* panel 
category with @product@'s other content-based apps. This integrates it nicely in 
the spot where Site administrators expect it to be. This also means you don't 
have to create a new category for it: you can just create the panel entry, which 
is what you'll do next. If you'd like to learn more about panel categories and 
apps after this, see the 
[product menu tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-the-product-menu)
and the 
[control menu tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/customizing-the-control-menu).

Follow these steps to create the panel entry for the Guestbook Admin portlet: 

1.  Add the dependency you need to extend @product@'s panel categories and apps. 
    To do this, open `guestbook-web`'s `build.gradle` file and add this 
    dependency: 

        compileOnly group: "com.liferay", name: "com.liferay.application.list.api", version: "2.0.0"

2.  Right-click `guestbook-web` and select *Gradle* &rarr; *Refresh Gradle 
    Project*. 

3.  Right-click `src/main/java` in the `guestbook-web` project and select *New* 
    &rarr; *Package*. Name the package 
    `com.liferay.docs.guestbook.application.list` and click *Finish*. 

4.  Right-click your new package and select *New* &rarr; *Class*. Name the class 
    `GuestbookAdminPanelApp`.
 
5.  Click *Browse* next to Superclass, search for 
    `BasePanelApp`, select it, and click *OK*. Then click *Finish*. 

Great! You've created the classes you need, and you're ready to begin working on
them.
