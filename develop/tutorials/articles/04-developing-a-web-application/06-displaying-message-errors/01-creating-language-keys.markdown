Any modern application should place its messages and form field labels in a 
language keys file that can be duplicated and then translated into multiple 
languages. Here, you'll learn how to provide a *default* set of English language 
keys for your application. For more information on language keys and providing 
automatically translated language keys, 
[see this tutorial](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/automatically-generating-language-files).

Language keys are stored in the `Language.properties` file included in your 
`guestbook-web` module. `Language.properties` is the default, but you can create 
a number of translations by appending the ISO-639 language code to the file name
(e.g., `Language_es.properties` for Spanish or `Language_de.properties` for
German). For now, stick to the default language keys. 

Follow these steps to create your language keys:

1.  Open `/src/main/resources/content/Language.properties` in your 
    `guestbook-web` module. Remove the default keys in this file. 

2.  Paste in the following keys: 

        entry-added=Entry added successfully.
        entry-deleted=Entry deleted successfully.
        guestbook-added=Guestbook added successfully.
        guestbook-updated=Guestbook updated successfully.
        guestbook-deleted=Guestbook deleted successfully.

3.  Save the file. 

Your messages are now in place, and your application can use them. Next, you'll 
add them to your action methods.
