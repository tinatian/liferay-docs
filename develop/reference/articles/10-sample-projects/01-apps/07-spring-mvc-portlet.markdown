# Spring MVC Portlet [](id=spring-mvc-portlet)

The Spring MVC portlet provides a way to add various different fields into the
database and display them in a table. This project is a Spring MVC based portlet
WAR that implements the same functionality as the
`apps/service-builder/basic-web` sample project. It manages JSP pages for
display, uses a Spring-annotated portlet class, and invokes the
`apps/service-builder/basic-api` module to call services.

**Note:** If you're planning to package this sample using Maven, you must
complete a few additional steps to avoid build errors. This sample relies on the
`service-builder/basic-api` module. Since the `basic-api` bundle is not
available on Liferay's CDN repo or Maven Central, this sample can not reference
it, resulting in build failures.

To satisfy this dependency, you must install the bundle dependency to your local
`~/.m2 repo`, along with the parent BND plugin and root Maven project. Here are
the steps to accomplish this:

1.  Run `mvn clean install` on `maven/apps/service-builder/basic-api`.
2.  Run `mvn clean install` on `maven/parent.bnd.bundle.plugin`.
3.  Run `mvn clean install -N` in the root `liferay-blade-samples/maven` folder.

Now you can build this sample successfully.

Unlike the `service-builder/basic-web` module, Spring MVC portlets must be
delivered as portlet WAR projects. This project builds to a WAR file but
leverages all of the Liferay Workspace tools and Gradle to build the WAR. You
must build and deploy the `service-builder/basic-api` and
`service-builder/basic-service` modules for this sample to work properly. For
more information on using Spring MVC portlets in @product@, visit the
[Spring MVC](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/spring-mvc) tutorial.

## What API(s) and/or code components does this sample highlight? [](id=what-apis-and-or-code-components-does-this-sample-highlight)

This sample demonstrates a @product@ portlet built using the
[Spring Web MVC framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/html/mvc.html).

## How does this sample leverage the API(s) and/or code component? [](id=how-does-this-sample-leverage-the-apis-and-or-code-component)

You can easily modify this sample by customizing its
`SpringMVCPortletViewController` Java class or any of its JSPs stored in the
`src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/jsp` folder. For more information on customizing this
sample, see the Javadoc listed in this sample's `SpringMVCPortletViewController`
Java class.

## Where Is This Sample? [](id=where-is-this-sample)

There are three different versions of this sample, each built with a different
build tool:

- [Gradle](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/7.1/gradle/apps/springmvc-portlet)
- [Liferay Workspace](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/7.1/liferay-workspace/wars/springmvc-portlet)
- [Maven](https://github.com/liferay/liferay-blade-samples/tree/7.1/maven/apps/springmvc-portlet)
