# Planning Your App's Distribution [](id=planning-your-apps-distribution)

When you start the formal process of submitting your app to the Marketplace, in
addition to uploading your app's files you must answer a host of important
questions. For example, you must clarify who owns the app, specify pricing for
the app, define its licensing scheme (if it's a paid app), associate a person or
company as its owner and maintainer, and specify the versions of Liferay that
the app supports. Your answers to these questions help you determine if you must
package multiple versions of the app. This tutorial prepares you by explaining
the questions and ways you might answer them. Here's what's covered:

- [Selling your app or making it free](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/selling-your-app-or-making-it-free)
- [Publishing as an individual or on behalf of a company](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/publishing-as-an-individual-or-on-behalf-of-a-company)
- [Licensing and pricing your app](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/licensing-and-pricing-your-app)
- [App versioning and target Liferay editions and versions](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/targeting-liferay-editions-and-versions)

The first tutorial answers this question: Should I sell my app or make it free?
