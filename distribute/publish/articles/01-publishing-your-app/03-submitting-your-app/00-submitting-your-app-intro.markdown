# Submitting Your App [](id=submitting-your-app)

Now that you have everything in order for publishing your app, you can start the
Marketplace app submission process. 

Go to your *Account Home* on 
[liferay.com](http://www.liferay.com). 
In the left side navigation panel of your profile page, there are links to pages
related to using apps and developing apps. Links to *Apps* and *Metrics* appear
in the *Development* section of the navigation panel. You'll use these
links heavily during development, so you may want to bookmark this page too.
Click *Apps* from the *Development* section to access your app development page.

Now that you know how to get to your app development page, you can submit your
app! It involves,

- [Uploading your app](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/uploading-your-app)

- [Submitting your app for review](/distribute/how-to-publish/-/knowledge_base/how-to-publish/submitting-your-app-for-review)

To begin the process of publishing your app, click *Add New App*. The app wizard
appears, so that you can fill in your app's details.
