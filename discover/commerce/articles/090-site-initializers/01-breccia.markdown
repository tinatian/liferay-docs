# Breccia [](id=breccia)

The Breccia Accelerator adopts the site model used by most major retailers.
Its home page enables searching for individual products, while a series of
links connect to product category pages. Familiar cart and checkout features
are also included. Breccia gives you a ready-made theme, a complete set of
customer-facing pages, a sample catalog divided into basic categories, and
populated country and currency lists.

## Theme [](id=theme)

Several functions are embedded in the Breccia theme, including a search bar and
several links. Users can access the site's catalog, their personal accounts, or
their virtual carts. In addition to the search bar, the *Explore Products* menu
shows product categories from any page on the site.

## Pages [](id=pages)

Running the Breccia Accelerator creates several pages and places various
applications---furnished with appropriate display templates---on them. To see
Breccia's pages, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Build* &rarr; *Pages*.

![Figure 2: To see a page's layout and widgets, click [options](../../images/icon-kebab-blue-on-white.png) &rarr; *View*.](../../images/breccia-pages.png)

In general, these pages work as described in 
[Setting up a Storefront](/web/emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/setting-up-a-storefront).
The site's *Catalog* page, however, is a little different. The page contains
a category detail widget, so it is the target of all the links in the site's
*category navigation* widgets (as well those in the embedded *Explore Products*
menu). When a user selects a category from one of those links, she is directed
to the *Catalog* page, which displays content appropriate to the selected
category.

![Figure 3: The *Catalog* page takes whatever shape is called for by the displayed products.](../../images/breccia-catalog-page.png)

The *Catalog* page can also be accessed from the embedded link at the top of
every page. In this case, however, there is no option to filter results by
category. As a result, the category detail widget remains invisible, and the
search results widget displays all products in the site's catalog.

![Figure 4: Search results can be filtered using the facets widgets to the left of the page.](../../images/breccia-facets.png).

Keep in mind that there is no option to sort products by category in this case.
However, you can offer that functionality by dropping a *category facets* widget
onto the page.

![Figure 5: *Category facets* still appear---displaying a single option---even when the *Catalog* page is only used to display a single category.](../../images/breccia-category-facet.png)

## Catalog [](id=catalog)

Not to be confused with Breccia's catalog page---a display page for
customers---is the site's actual catalog, which stores data on its products.
Breccia's catalog includes a range of sample products divided into a handful of
categories; these products have been assigned options, specifications, images,
and SKUs.

![Figure 6: Of course, sample products are no help if you're setting up a live store---but they can save you a lot of time if you're working to understand the functionality described in [Catalog Management](/web/emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/catalog-management)](../../images/breccia-catalog.png).

## Settings [](id=settings)

Breccia populates some of the fields in *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr;
*Settings*.

**Countries:** Breccia populates the countries list in *Settings* &rarr;
*Countries* tab. With the exception of the US and Italy, *regions* lists are
not populated. See
[Countries](/web/emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/countries)
for more details.

**Currencies:** The currency list in *Settings* &rarr; *Currencies* tab is
populated with several of the world's most widely-used currencies. See
[Currencies](/web/emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/currencies)
for information on updating exchange rates and other details.
