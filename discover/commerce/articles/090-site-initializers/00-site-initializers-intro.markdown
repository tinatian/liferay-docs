# Acclerators [](id=accelerators)

An Accelerator is a type of Site template that does much of the work of
setting up a store. An Accelerator is a convenient sandbox for gaining
familiarity with @commerce@, but it can also be a head start on setting up a live
Site.

Typically, an Accelerator gives you a theme, a set of customer-facing pages
with a working interface, and a sample catalog.
