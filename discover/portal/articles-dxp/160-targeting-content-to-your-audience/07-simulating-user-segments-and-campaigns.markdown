# Simulating User Segments and Campaigns [](id=simulating-user-segments-and-campaigns)

Once you create all those segments, you'll likely want to test them. The
Audience Targeting Simulator can preview the way pages appear to different
user segments. It appears under the *Simulation* icon
(![Simulation](../../images-dxp/icon-simulation.png)) in the top Control Menu. 

1.  Click on the Simulator icon to open the right-side panel.

2.  Select *User Segments*.

The Audience Targeting Simulator is only visible to users with the View
permission for the Audience Targeting Simulator.

**Note:** You can grant Audience Targeting permissions by clicking *Actions* &rarr;
*Define Permissions* menu for the appropriate Roles in the Control Panel. When
defining permissions for a Role, go to *Site Administration* &rarr;
*Configuration* to find the *Audience Targeting* section.

Go to the User Segments tab of the Audience Targeting simulator to see a list
of all the user segments available for the Site. Selecting segments lets you
see how the website would appear to them. You can navigate around your Site as
if you were a user that matched the selected user segments.

Next, you'll examine all the Audience Targeting rules available for you to use
by default.
