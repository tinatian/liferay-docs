# Targeting Content To Your Audience [](id=targeting-content-to-your-audience)

Audience Targeting provides tools to customize user experience based on 
demographics, browsing data, or other criteria. You can divide your audience 
into user segments, target content to them, and create campaigns to get content
to the right people. 

With Liferay's [Audience Targeting app](http://www.liferay.com/marketplace),
developers can easily create additional rules and rule types with minimal
coding effort. Campaigns last for fixed periods of time and each campaign has
a priority that determines which campaign takes precedence, and you can
configure different assets to be displayed at different periods of time to the
targeted user segment.

You can also measure the effectiveness of your campaigns. Different assets are
shown to different users, and campaigns display specific content to different
user segments for fixed periods of time, measuring the interaction of the
targeted user segments with the chosen content.

You can use Audience Targeting to display different sets of advertisements to
different user segments, and this can dynamically change every week based on
your marketing goals. Or you can display news articles to users based on all
the user segments to which they belong. 

Audience Targeting meets all of the requirements for anonymization, erasure,
and export for compliance with [GDPR](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-1/tracking-user-actions-with-audience-targeting).
 
The Audience Targeting App appears in the Configuration section of Site
Administration. It also adds a User Segments Simulator in the Simulation
Menu. The following three applications are also included with the Audience
Targeting app:

- Campaign Content Display
- User Segment Content Display
- User Segment Content List

You can add these widgets to any @product@ page. In the next sections, you'll
lean how to use the *Audience Targeting* section of the Site Administration
area to manage user segments and campaigns. Then you'll learn how to use each
of the Audience Targeting applications and the Audience Targeting Simulator.
